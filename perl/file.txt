there was no possibility of taking a walk that day. we had been wandering, 
indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; 
but since dinner (mrs. reed, when there was no company, dined early) 
the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, 
and a rain so penetrating, 
that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question.
