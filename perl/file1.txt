THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF TAKING A WALK THAT DAY. WE HAD BEEN WANDERING, 
INDEED, IN THE LEAFLESS SHRUBBERY AN HOUR IN THE MORNING; 
BUT SINCE DINNER (MRS. REED, WHEN THERE WAS NO COMPANY, DINED EARLY) 
THE COLD WINTER WIND HAD BROUGHT WITH IT CLOUDS SO SOMBRE, 
AND A RAIN SO PENETRATING, 
THAT FURTHER OUTDOOR EXERCISE WAS NOW OUT OF THE QUESTION.
